* Static deployment
  + Retrieve eggs and their dependencies
    - Determine dependencies and order of compilation of eggs
  + Compile eggs into object files with import libraries that don't
    have dependencies
    =csc -c -J -unit egg0 egg0/egg0.scm -o egg0.o=
  + Do the same for those with dependencies
    =csc -c -J -unit egg1 -uses egg0 egg1/egg1.scm -o egg1.o=
  + Compile the object files of the program the same way
  + Compile the main file by linking everything together
    =csc -c -uses egg0 -uses egg1 main.scm -o main.o=
  + Build the executable by statically linking the library
    =csc -static *.o -o rfc=
  + Write a Makefile for this monstrosity.
